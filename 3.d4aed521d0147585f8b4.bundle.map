You can also use {@link NgModelGroup} if you'd like to create\n * sub-groups within the form.\n *\n * You can listen to the directive's `ngSubmit` event to be notified when the user has\n * triggered a form submission.

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {@link FormControl} and {@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Adding or removing controls\n *\n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * @stable\n */\nvar FormArray = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArray, _super);\n    function FormArray(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.at = function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.push = function (control) {\n        this.controls.push(control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.insert = function (index, control) {\n        this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.removeAt = function (index) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.setControl = function (index, control) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        if (control) {\n            this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n            this._registerControl(control);\n        }\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArray.prototype, \"length\", {\n        /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.controls.length; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     *  Sets the value of the {@link FormArray}.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  @stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__model__[\"b\" /* FormControl */]();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"f\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_10__shared__[\"g\" /* isPropertyUpdated */])(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this);

Unlike {@link FormControlName},\n * it does not require that your {@link FormControl} instance be part of any parent\n * {@link FormGroup}, and it won't be registered to any {@link FormGroupDirective} that\n * exists above it.\n *\n * **Get the value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the\n * {@link FormControl} instance. See a full list of available properties in\n * {@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can pass in an initial value when instantiating the {@link FormControl},\n * or you can set it programmatically later using {@link AbstractControl.setValue} or\n * {@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\n * {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormControl/simple_form_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n *\n *  @stable\n */\nvar FormControlDirective = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlDirective, _super);\n    function FormControlDirective(validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6__shared__[\"f\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlDirective.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        set: function (isDisabled) { __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_5__reactive_errors__[\"a\" /* ReactiveErrors */].disabledAttrWarning();

Conversely,\n * any values written to the DOM element through user input will be reflected in the\n * {@link FormControl} instance (view -> model).\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * This directive is designed to be used with a parent {@link FormGroupDirective} (selector:\n * `[formGroup]`).\n *\n * It accepts the string name of the {@link FormControl} instance you want to\n * link, and will look for a {@link FormControl} registered with that name in the\n * closest {@link FormGroup} or {@link FormArray} above it.\n *\n * **Access the control**: You can access the {@link FormControl} associated with\n * this directive by using the {@link AbstractControl.get} method.\n * Ex: `this.form.get('first');`\n *\n * **Get value**: the `value` property is always synced and available on the {@link FormControl}.\n * See a full list of available properties in {@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n *  **Set value**: You can set an initial value for the control when instantiating the\n *  {@link FormControl}, or you can set it programmatically later using\n *  {@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {@link AbstractControl.patchValue}.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the control, you can\n * subscribe to the {@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also listen to\n * {@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} to be notified when the validation status is\n * re-calculated.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * In this example, we create form controls for first name and last name.\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleFormGroup/simple_form_group_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `formControlName` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: {@link ReactiveFormsModule}\n *\n *  @stable\n */\nvar FormControlName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormControlName, _super);\n    function FormControlName(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._added = false;\n        this.update = new __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_async__[\"a\" /* EventEmitter */]();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8__shared__[\"f\" /* selectValueAccessor */])(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(FormControlName.prototype, \"isDisabled\", {\n        set: function (isDisabled) { __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_7__reactive_errors__[\"a\" /* ReactiveErrors */].disabledAttrWarning();

You do\n * **not** need to add a special selector to activate it.\n *\n * ### How to use select controls with form directives\n *\n * To use a select in a template-driven form, simply add an `ngModel` and a `name`\n * attribute to the main `<select>` tag.\n *\n * If your option values are simple strings, you can bind to the normal `value` property\n * on the option.  If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /** @internal */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n    }\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var valueString = _buildValueString(this._getOptionId(value), value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /** @internal */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (looseIdentical(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /** @internal */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {@link FormControl} and {@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg. These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Adding or removing controls\n *\n * To change the controls in the array, use the `push`, `insert`, or `removeAt` methods\n * in `FormArray` itself. These methods ensure the controls are properly tracked in the\n * form's hierarchy. Do not modify the array of `AbstractControl`s used to instantiate\n * the `FormArray` directly, as that will result in strange and unexpected behavior such\n * as broken change detection.\n *\n * * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport var FormArray = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArray, _super);\n    function FormArray(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     * Get the {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.at = function (index) { return this.controls[index]; };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the end of the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.push = function (control) {\n        this.controls.push(control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Insert a new {@link AbstractControl} at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.insert = function (index, control) {\n        this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n        this._registerControl(control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove the control at the given `index` in the array.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.removeAt = function (index) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     */\n    FormArray.prototype.setControl = function (index, control) {\n        if (this.controls[index])\n            this.controls[index]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        this.controls.splice(index, 1);\n        if (control) {\n            this.controls.splice(index, 0, control);\n            this._registerControl(control);\n        }\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArray.prototype, \"length\", {\n        /**\n         * Length of the control array.\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.controls.length; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     *  Sets the value of the {@link FormArray}.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * @howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {@link @Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  @stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?
